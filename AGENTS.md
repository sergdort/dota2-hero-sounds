## Build & Test

```bash
pnpm build                          # compile TypeScript to dist/
pnpm build && node dist/cli.js test # build and test all sound categories
node dist/cli.js test <category>    # test one category: success, error, attention, start
node dist/cli.js list               # show all sounds by category
node dist/cli.js install --claude   # install Claude Code hooks
node dist/cli.js install --opencode # install OpenCode plugin
node dist/cli.js install --pi       # install Pi extension
node dist/cli.js install --all      # install for all tools
node dist/cli.js uninstall          # remove all hooks/plugins
node dist/cli.js hero list          # show available heroes with per-category counts
node dist/cli.js hero set axe pudge # set preferred heroes
node dist/cli.js hero show          # show current hero preference
node dist/cli.js hero clear         # clear preference (use all heroes)
pnpm test                           # run unit tests
pnpm test:watch                     # run tests in watch mode
pnpm lint                           # check for lint/format issues
pnpm check                          # auto-fix lint/format issues
```

## Architecture

```
src/
  play-sound.ts     — Core: category definitions, random selection, afplay, hero filtering
  play.ts           — Standalone entry point for hooks: node dist/play.js <category>
  cli.ts            — Commander.js CLI (install/uninstall/test/list/hero)
  config.ts         — Reads/writes hero config from ~/.config/dota2-sounds/config.json
  heroes.ts         — Hero extraction from filenames, filtering, listing
  claude-hooks.ts   — Reads/writes Claude Code hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json
  opencode-plugin.ts — Generates self-contained OpenCode plugin to ~/.config/opencode/plugins/
  pi-extension.ts   — Installs/removes Pi extension via `pi install`/`pi remove`
pi-extension/
  index.ts          — Pi extension entry point (loaded by Pi via jiti, no compilation)
  package.json      — Pi package manifest with "pi" key
sounds/
  success/          — Positive/victorious lines (task completion)
  error/            — Defeat/blame/sadness lines (failures)
  attention/        — Waiting/thinking lines (permission prompts)
  start/            — Battle cries/power-up lines (session start)
```

### Key implementation details

- Claude Code hooks call `node <abs-path>/dist/play.js <category>` with absolute paths resolved at install time
- Hooks are tagged with `# dota2-code-sounds` comment for clean install/uninstall
- OpenCode plugin uses `session.status` busy->idle transition for completion detection, not `session.idle`
- OpenCode plugin plays start sound on plugin init since `session.created` fires before plugin loads
- Pi extension uses `session_start`, `agent_end`, `tool_execution_end`, and `session_shutdown` events
- Pi extension plays attention sound only for dangerous bash commands (rm, sudo, chmod, etc.)
- Sound playback is async/non-blocking (detached `afplay` process)
- All sound players have a 3-second debounce cooldown to prevent overlapping sounds
- Hero preferences stored in `~/.config/dota2-sounds/config.json`, read at runtime by all tools
- Hero name extracted from filename prefix `Vo_<hero>_` — first segment after `Vo_` is the hero key
- If configured heroes have no sounds for a category, falls back to all heroes

### Event mapping per tool

Only events with certain detection are implemented. If a tool doesn't support a scenario, it's not implemented.

| Scenario | Claude Code | OpenCode | Pi |
|----------|------------|----------|----|
| Session start | `SessionStart` | plugin init | `session_start` |
| Task complete | `Stop` | `session.status` busy→idle | `agent_end` |
| Error/failure | `PostToolUseFailure` | `session.error` | `tool_execution_end` (`isError`) |
| Needs attention | `Notification` | `permission.asked` | *not supported* |
| Session exit | *not supported* | *not supported* | `session_shutdown` |

## Sound Categories

Sounds are organized into subdirectories matching their category:

- **success** — positive/victorious lines for task completion (e.g. "Good work!", "Axe-actly!", "All mine!")
- **error** — defeat/blame/sadness lines for failures (e.g. "All your fault!", "Bury me here.", "All fall down.")
- **attention** — waiting/thinking lines for permission prompts (e.g. "Hey, I was thinking!", "Be still.")
- **start** — battle cries/power-up lines for session start (e.g. "TO THE ENEMY!", "Back for more!")

Categorize by the line's *emotional meaning*, not its literal words. Voice lines come from various Dota 2 heroes, not only Axe.

To transcribe an unfamiliar sound file:
```bash
whisper-cli -m /opt/homebrew/share/whisper-cpp/ggml-base.en.bin --no-timestamps -f sounds/<category>/<file>.mp3
```

## Contributing

1. Add new `.mp3` files to the appropriate `sounds/<category>/` subdirectory
2. Sound files are discovered at runtime — no code changes needed
3. Run `pnpm build` to compile
4. Run `node dist/cli.js install` to regenerate hooks/plugin
5. macOS only (uses `afplay`); cross-platform support planned for future

## Versioning

Version format is `YY.M.DD[.patch]` based on the current date. Examples:
- First release on March 22, 2026: `26.3.22`
- Second release same day: `26.3.22.2`
- Third release same day: `26.3.22.3`
- First release next day: `26.3.23`

Version must be updated in three places: `package.json`, `src/cli.ts` (`.version()`), and `pi-extension/package.json`.

## Agent notes

- Every time you learn something new, or how to do something in the codebase, if you make a mistake that the user corrects, if you find yourself running commands that are often wrong and have to tweak them: write all of this down in `.agents/notes.md`. This is a file just for you that your user won't read.
- If you're about to write to it, first check if what you're writing (the idea, not 1:1) is already present. If so, increment the counter in the prefix (eg from `[0]` to `[1]`). If it's completely new, prefix it with `[0]`. Once a comment hits the count of `3`, codify it into this AGENTS.md file in the `## Misc` section.
